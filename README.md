# Real-time-Network-Traffic-Classifier-IDS
This project develops and deploys a robust, multi-class Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of identifying various attack types and normal network traffic. Leveraging a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, the system is trained on the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset, which features a wide range of modern attacks.
